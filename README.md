#  BAZAAR WEB APP Final Project for CS50 2019 HarvardX course
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
BAZAAR is a website where people post or search various announcements for job, selling used items or lost / found items.

The website uses Python and Flask for backend with SQLAlchmey, SQLite database, and HTML/CSS with Bootstrap 5 on frontend.
I chose bootstrap instead of manual HTML/CSS which allowed me faster prototyping and the usage of bootstrap themes. The theme i used can be found on this page https://bootswatch.com/ and its called "Sketchy"
